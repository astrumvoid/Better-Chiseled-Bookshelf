A simple mod that makes the chiseled bookshelves better by making them give enchantment power based on many books are in it, working as a normal shelf once full. As a nice bonus, enchanted books gives double the enchantment power.

**Compatible with Easy Magic and Jade.**

In case of bugs, report to me on **voidtyron** in discord

Can technically be used as a library, but I'm working on giving it more uses.

# Available Settings:
- **Bigger Table**: If set to **true**, will make so the shelves can be placed up to a **2 blocks away** from the table, instead of the **default 1**. 
- **Modify Redstone Output**: If set to **true**, the comparator redstone output will be changed from **“Last Interacted Slot”** to the amount of books in the shelf (1 of power per book, 2 per enchanted book) 
- **Particle Chance**: Allows you to change how frequent the enchantment table will create particles, the lower = more particles will spawn. **Defaults to 16**. 
- **Normal Book Power**: Allows you to change how much power a single book is worth. Defaults to ~0.16 (a lot of six), since this multiplied by 6 is 1. 
- **Enchanted Power**: Allows you to change how much power a single enchanted book is worth. Defaults to ~0.33 (a lot of three), since this multiplied by six is 2.
- **Multiply Normal Book**: If set to **true**, this will make so the enchanted book power is **ALWAYS** the normal book power times the set multiplier. **Defaults to true**.
- **Multiplier**: Sets how many much more power the enchanted book gives. Only works if **Multiply Normal Book* is set to true. **Defaults to 2**.
### For Forge Users
This mod will not receive any future update for forge (will be changed to neoforge). The reasons are:
- No newer Architectury API version for forge
- Config API that using does not support newer forge versions.
